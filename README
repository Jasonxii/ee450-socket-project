	2. the aws to the serverA or serverB: char[]
	(link_id+" ")
	3. the serverA or serverB to the aws: char[]
	" "(not found) or (link_id,bandwidth,length,velocity,noise_power+" ")
	4. the aws to the serverC: char[]
	" "(not found) or (link_id,bandwidth,length,velocity,noise_power+" "+link_id+" "+size+" "+power+" ")
	5. the serverC to the aws: char[]
	" "(not found) or (Tt+" "+Tp+" "+delay+" ")
	6. the aws to the client: char[]
